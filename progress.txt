While we have not made a great deal of progress on the programming side of the project, we have put a great deal of consideration into how the files in 
our program will be organized (what methods refer to which classes) and what each of us will be working on for the remainder of the project.

Timothy is working on the theater creation system of the program. When this system is finished, users (as in managers) will be able to add new movie theaters 
to the system and configure the layout of each room in the theater. A few different class objects have been created, including a (currently incomplete) method 
that automatically creates rooms with specified seat layouts (including handicaped spots). 

Sara is working on the user interface for the program, as well as the theater objects which contain information about a movie the theater will be playing. 
She is almost finished writing a plan for how the user interface will be handled, and will write the code for it as soon as she is done.

Abhisek is working on the ticketing system for the program. This will be the main feature that brings the program to life, as it will automatically find 
seating arrangements for customers depending on what movie they plan on seeing.
